1. I had an issue with aligning and centering the logo and button for the "order now" to be placed above the Banner image.
2. I had an issue with the footer placement and image overlay. This fixed with following this instruction. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp
3. I had an issue with column being to far spread out. I applied Col-2 to the images in each row and a Col-4 to the text. This fixed the issue. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/#gutters
4. I had issue with the Koala App stopping to compile my LESS code. I switch the Easy LESS extension in VS Code per direction from Alex Ram. This remedied the issue.
